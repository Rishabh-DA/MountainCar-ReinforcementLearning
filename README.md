# MountainCar-ReinforcementLearning

## overview
A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains". The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.

## implementation
Implemented using dueling deep Q learning algorithm to solve MountainCar environment
